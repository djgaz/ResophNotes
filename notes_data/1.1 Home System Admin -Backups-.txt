Ok here we are with a system of backups..

List backup file and where they are

List philosophical approaches
I had a limited directory model
and I had a full backup with specific directories and types excluded.

This second is where I need focus...

Lastly  there have been backups done in the past.
These need to be woven into the mix correcely and removed 
from their position of hanging out like a sore thumb......
