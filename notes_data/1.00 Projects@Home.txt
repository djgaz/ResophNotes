12/30/15 This needs to be combined with what's in 1.0_CurrentToDo__OrDoing Oct`15 and organized.

Projects:

!!!  Backup this fucking disk  !!!

Big deal archival of Yahoo mail.  
* Java Selenium to mine the Yahoo mail 
* Web front end to Postgres to be the local repository
* WebSite and postgres on a Ubuntu VM in Virtual Box.

Preceeding that....
Ubuntu VM with Apache installed
* Requires configuration that will allow the VM to get out to the internet
* And will allow a website to be published.
* So, it needs two way network access


Ubuntu VM in Virtual box
* Local install
* Do a Vagrant install of trusty 64 ... ?

Do I need a second VM, one with a GUI ?
* would I be able to get at one from the other ??
